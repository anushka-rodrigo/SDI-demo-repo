# An Evaluation of Student Performances in Online vs. Physical Learning Environments

## Project Overview

With the rise of online learning during the pandemic and its continued use alongside traditional physical classes, it is essential to understand how different learning environments affect academic performance.  

This project investigates whether the mode of education—**online** or **physical**—has a significant impact on students' academic outcomes. The study involves data collection through surveys, analysis, and hypothesis testing to report any statistically significant differences between students attending online versus physical classes.

## Research Objectives

- Compare academic performances between online and physically participating students.  
- Assess if the mode of education influences overall academic output.  
- Examine student preferences and perspectives toward online and physical learning environments.  
- Statistically test if the mean performances differ between the two groups.

## Data Source

Data for this project is collected through a combination of:  

- **Primary data**: Structured questionnaires sent to a target audience to capture information such as mode of learning, grades, engagement levels, and satisfaction.  
- **Secondary data**: Supplementary data obtained from existing studies or reports for comparative analysis.

## Project Structure

- **R Scripts**:  
  - Scripts for analyzing performance, computing weighted means, and performing statistical tests.
  - `Impact in online learning.R` - grand mean regarding impact students face in online learning.
  - `Impact in physical learning.R` - grand mean regarding impact students face in physical learning.
  - `Challenges in online learning.R` - grand mean regarding challenges students face in online learning.
  - `Challenges in physical learning.R` - grand mean regarding challenges students face in physical learning.
  - `Final mean and SD of online learning.R` - Final calculations in online learning used for hypothesis testing.
  - `Final mean and SD of physical learning.R` - Final calculations in physical learning  used for hypothesis testing.
  - `Hypothesis testing.R` - Performs hypothesis test for the dataset.

- **Data Files**:  
  - `Sample_Responses` - Survey responses used for analysis.
  - `Questionaire_calculations.xlsx` – Survey responses used for analysis with calculations through excel functions (for references).
